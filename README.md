## Blocking Domains in Cisco Umbrella Automated by Tines
For Security Operations, IOC management is a challenge.  

How does one team with limited time and resources track Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in all their security solutions and lifecycle them appropriately?  

Tines makes this challenge much easier through their SOAR automation platform.

This past month, we launched a Tines webform, where a security analyst can add IOCs to all our backend security solutions.  In addtion, a ServiceNow incident is logged along with sharing the IOCs with our partner institutions via [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP), the open-source threat intel sharing platform.

Prior to the IOC management webform project, I did not work with the Cisco Umbrella API.
